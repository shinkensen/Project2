## 🆘 Troubleshooting Guide

### Installation Issues

**❌ "npm install failed"**
```powershell
# Clean and reinstall
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
Remove-Item package-lock.json
npm install
```

**❌ "Cannot find module"**
- Make sure you ran `npm install` successfully
- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (should be v16+)

### Supabase Connection Issues

**❌ "supabaseUrl is required" or "Invalid API key"**

1. Check `.env` file exists in project root
2. Verify values are correct (no extra spaces/quotes)
3. Make sure you copied the FULL keys (very long strings)
4. Restart server after changing `.env`

**❌ "Failed to connect to Supabase"**

1. Check Supabase project is active (not paused)
2. Test in browser: Visit your `SUPABASE_URL` - should show a page
3. Verify API keys match in Supabase Settings → API

**❌ "Permission denied" or "Row level security policy violation"**

1. Confirm you ran the FULL `database/schema.sql`
2. Check for errors in SQL Editor when you ran it
3. Policies might not be set up - see Step 2.4

### Upload/Storage Issues

**❌ "Upload failed" or "Storage error"**

1. Verify bucket `fridge-images` exists
2. Check bucket is set to **Private** (not public)
3. Confirm storage policies are added (Step 2.4)
4. Try creating a new file in Storage UI to test permissions

**❌ "Access denied to storage bucket"**

- User must be signed in (authenticated)
- Bucket policies must allow user to access their own folder
- Check policies in Storage → fridge-images → Policies

### Email Notification Issues

**❌ "Email not sending"**

1. **Using Gmail?** Must use **App Password** (not regular password)
2. **2FA enabled?** Required for App Passwords
3. **Check spam folder** - first emails often go to spam
4. **Test SMTP:** Use online SMTP tester with your credentials
5. **Check server logs** for email errors

**❌ "Invalid login" or "Authentication failed"**

- Regular Gmail password won't work - must generate App Password
- App Password is 16 characters (ignore spaces)
- Make sure EMAIL_USER matches the Google account you created App Password for

### Computer Vision Issues

**❌ "CV detection not working" or stuck on "Processing..."**

1. **First time?** TensorFlow.js downloads ~10MB (takes 10-15 seconds)
2. **Use modern browser:** Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Edge 90+
3. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
4. **Try smaller image:** Large images take longer
5. **WebGL support:** Visit [get.webgl.org](https://get.webgl.org) to check

**❌ "No items detected"**

- CV model only detects common food items
- Try photos with visible, recognizable items (banana, apple, bottle, etc.)
- Good lighting helps detection accuracy
- Try adding items manually if CV doesn't detect well

### Recipe API Issues

**❌ "Failed to load recipes"**

- Without API key: App uses mock recipes (this is normal)
- With API key: Check spelling of `SPOONACULAR_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Free tier limit: 150 requests/day (check usage in Spoonacular dashboard)
- Mock recipes show 2-3 generic recipes when API fails

### Port and Server Issues

**❌ "Port 3000 already in use" or "EADDRINUSE"**

```powershell
# Find what's using port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Option 1: Kill the process
Stop-Process -Id <PID>

# Option 2: Use different port in .env
PORT=3001
```

**❌ Server starts but can't access in browser**

- Try `http://localhost:3000` (not 127.0.0.1)
- Check firewall isn't blocking Node.js
- Try different browser
